Membership solely confers the right to use and enjoy the Facility in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by Owner, as they may be changes from time to time.</li>
        <li><strong>Approval of Membership</strong><br />
          Only on-site employees of Project tenants in good standing who are 18 years of age and older are eligible for membership. Memberships are non-refundable and non-transferrable.</li>
        <li><strong>Fees and Dues / Billing / Notices</strong><br />
          Paid members shall be billed at monthly intervals coinciding with their membership inception date (the  &ldquo;Monthly Billing Date&rdquo;). For example, if a member joined on the 8th of the month, the member’s card will be charged on the 8th of each subsequent month. Membership fees are subject to change without notice. All notices to Owner must be given, and all payments due to Owner must be made, to Owner’s property manager for the Project at the address designated by that property manager from time to time.</li>
        <li><strong>Membership Cancellation</strong>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Voluntary Cancellation</strong>. Members can cancel their membership at any time. For example, if a member joined on the 8th of the month, the member’s card will be charged on the 8th of each subsequent month. If a member cancels at any time within that month, their cancellation would be effective on the 7th of the following month. No resignation will be effective until all outstanding charges are paid in full.</li>
            <li><strong>Involuntary Cancellation</strong>. Owner reserves the right at any time to terminate the membership or privileges of any member for failure to comply with any of the rules or regulations adopted by Owner or for any conduct that Owner determines to be improper or in any way contrary to the best interest of Owner or any other member. All such memberships shall be deemed terminated upon transmission of written notification to the member’s last known address. The terminated member shall promptly (i) return all access cards to Owner and (ii) pay all outstanding charges in full. Owner may terminate the membership of any member who is forty-five (45) days in arrears with respect to any payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Death or Disability</strong>. If by reason of death or disability, a member is unable to use the services or facilities at the Facility, the member or the member’s estate, as applicable, shall be relieved from the obligation to pay any membership dues other than for those that accrued prior to death or the onset of disability.
